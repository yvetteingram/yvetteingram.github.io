Her strengths are supported by her excellent; purposeful, questioning skills and her clear writing skills. My work with Yvette was focused on the clarification, monitoring and increasing efficiency of work streams and processes. Typically this type of work is contentious due to suspicions surrounding the use of the resulting data. Yvette ability to objectively communicate purpose and need, influence resources and clarify processes and their capability has singularly supported my unit in being successful is assisting other organizations in their goal of creating more efficient and profitable business processes. I strongly recommended Yvette.",
